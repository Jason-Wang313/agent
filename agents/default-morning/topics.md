# Conversation Starter Bank — DawnAgent

<!--
PURPOSE: Curated pool of conversation openers and topics.
USE: When memory.md has no strong thread to pull, or as a complement to memory callbacks.
AGENT NOTE: Do NOT read this file top-to-bottom and use entries in order.
            Pick ONE entry per session that feels contextually right.
            Mark used entries to avoid repetition within two weeks.
ROTATION: After using an entry, add [USED: YYYY-MM-DD] after it.
          After 14 days, entries can be reused (remove the used marker).

## CURIOUS OBSERVATIONS

<!-- True, interesting things that naturally invite a response. -->
<!-- Deliver as genuine curiosity, not a trivia quiz. -->

- Octopuses have three hearts, and two of them stop beating when they swim. [ ]
- The word "morning" originally just meant the transition from night to day — not the whole period. [ ]
- Honey never expires. They found 3,000-year-old honey in Egyptian tombs. Still good. [ ]
- Crows remember individual human faces and can hold grudges for years. [ ]
- The inventor of the Pringles can is actually buried in one. True story. [ ]
- Trees in forests communicate through underground fungal networks — they share nutrients with sick neighbours. [ ]
- A group of flamingos is called a "flamboyance." [ ]
- The average person walks the equivalent of twice around the Earth in their lifetime. [ ]
- Sea otters hold hands while sleeping so they don't drift apart. [ ]
- Cleopatra lived closer in time to the Moon landing than to the construction of the Great Pyramid. [ ]
- Wombats produce cube-shaped droppings. Scientists recently figured out how. [ ]
- The Oxford English Dictionary has a word — "sonder" — for the realisation that every passerby has a life as complex as your own. [ ]

## LIGHT HYPOTHETICALS

<!-- Low-stakes questions that are genuinely fun to think about. -->
<!-- Good for when the user seems slightly more awake and conversational. -->

- If you had to add one subject to school curriculum, what would it be?
- What's the most useful skill you've accidentally picked up?
- If your morning had a theme song, what would it be today?
- What's something you own that you've had the longest — and why haven't you replaced it?
- If you could be immediately great at one thing (work or hobby, your choice), which would you pick?
- What's a food you've never had but feel like you should have tried by now?
- If you had one month completely free — no obligations, no guilt — what would you actually do?
- What's a place you keep meaning to visit but haven't gotten around to?
- If you could switch lives with someone for one week — anyone, real or fictional — who'd it be?

## CALLBACK PROMPTS

<!-- Use when memory.md has a relevant open thread. -->
<!-- Always adapt these to the specific memory — never use verbatim. -->

Templates:
- "Did you ever [follow up on X they mentioned]?"
- "Whatever happened with [open thread]?"
- "Are you still [doing that thing they were trying]?"
- "Last time you mentioned [X] — how'd that land?"
- "You said you wanted to [try/start/finish X] — did that happen?"

## CONTEXTUAL OPENERS

<!-- Based on day_of_week and time_bracket from conversation.md -->

### Monday
- "Monday again. How are you feeling about that, honestly?"
- "Weekend go too fast — or did you actually get to rest?"

### Friday
- "It's Friday. What does that actually mean for you today?"
- "Almost there. How's the week been, really?"

### Weekend (Saturday / Sunday)
- "No alarm pressure today, hopefully. What does a good morning look like for you on a [Saturday/Sunday]?"
- "Weekend. What are you actually doing with this one?"

### Early morning (before 7am)
- Start with [whispering] and [gentle] tags — match the quiet
- "You're up early. By choice, or...?"
- "This is an early one. What's going on?"

### Late morning (after 9:30am)
- More relaxed energy — [warm] and [cheerful] are fine
- "Looks like you let yourself sleep in. Good call or necessary?"
- "Late start. Sometimes that's exactly right."

## SEASONAL NOTES

<!-- Loose seasonal texture — don't overdo it, just a light touch if relevant -->

Winter:    dark mornings, feeling slow, hibernation instinct, the specific pleasures of warmth
Spring:    things starting again, energy shift, noticing small changes
Summer:    heat, light, longer evenings bleeding into mornings, energy or fatigue
Autumn:    winding down, the appeal of cozy, things ending or changing
